"""Drive Hinge's in-app Location (MyMove / "My neighborhood") via ADB.

Two JSON files:
  - `location_coords.json` — UI element coords (per-device, gitignored)
  - `locations.json`       — short-name -> Hinge-friendly search string map
    (committed; add cities as needed)

`set_location(name)`:
  1. Resolve `name` via locations.json (or use raw string if not mapped).
  2. From Discover: tap sliders icon -> Dating Preferences screen.
  3. Tap "My neighborhood" row -> Location picker.
  4. Tap text input -> tap X to clear any prior value -> type the city.
  5. Wait for autocomplete -> tap first suggestion.
  6. Tap back arrow -> commit and return to Preferences.
  7. Close Preferences (X top-left) -> back to Discover.

Verification is light — we trust the autocomplete's top suggestion to match
the typed city. If the first suggestion is wrong (e.g. an airport beats the
city in autocomplete for an obscure name), add a curated entry in
locations.json with a more specific search string (e.g. "Portland, OR").

Hinge+/X (MyMove) is required to change to a city outside your area.
Without it, the change may snap back. No verification of that here for v1.
