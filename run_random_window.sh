# Run hinge-auto at a random offset within the current hour.
# Intended for an external cron that fires every hour at :00.
#
# Usage: add to system crontab:
#   0 * * * * /home/ada/.openclaw/workspace/hinge-auto/run_random_window.sh
#
# Each hour picks a random delay 0-30min, sleeps, then runs the bot.
# Combined with the 0-2 random like cap, every run looks different.
