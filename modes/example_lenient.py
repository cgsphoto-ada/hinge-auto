"""Example mode — generous "default LIKE" rubric.

Demonstrates the mode-file format with a forgiving baseline: like almost
everyone, skip only on clear bot / spam / empty-profile signals. Copy this
to a new file and adapt the PREFERENCES string for your own taste.

Paired with `example_strict.py` (its antonym) so you can see the dynamic
range of what these prompts can do. Neither one represents anyone's
actual preferences — they exist as scaffolding.

Default decision: LIKE.

This is the lenient example. Be generous — a missed like costs much less
than a missed match. The vast majority of profiles should be liked.

Skip ONLY when one of these clearly applies:

1. The profile looks fake / bot-like / spam. Telltale signs: only one
   photo and it looks AI-generated or stock; bio is a single off-platform
   handle ("snap me at X", "find me on TikTok @Y"); the photos and the
   stated info contradict each other in obvious ways.

2. The profile is genuinely empty — no readable prompt answers, no
   meaningful bio, photos are all unrecognizable (e.g. only blurry group
   shots or pets, no person visible).

3. Explicit deal-breaker statements that put you well outside the
   intended audience. For most users this rule should fire rarely; do
   not invent deal-breakers that aren't actually stated on the profile.

Everything else is a LIKE. Specifically:

- Career, hobbies, vibe, photo quality, group dynamics, distance, height,
  whether they drink, what they post about — none of these are skip
  signals in this lenient mode.

- If the profile is OK but you can't think of a strong, specific opener,
  output decision=like with message="" and message_archetype="empty".
  A like with no message is better than a skip.

When writing the reasoning field:
- Reference concrete details ("photo 3 shows...", "the [prompt] answer
  about X").
- Stay neutral and non-judgmental about people. The point of this
  example is to demonstrate the FORMAT, not to take a position on who
  is or isn't worth liking. Adapt the PREFERENCES text above to your
  own taste in your own mode file.
