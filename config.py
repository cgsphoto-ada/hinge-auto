"""Configuration for HingeAuto.

PREFERENCES, AGE_MIN/MAX, and MESSAGE_VOICE come from the active mode (see
`modes/`). Set ACTIVE_MODE here for the persistent default; override per-run
via `python main.py --mode <name>`.

The COORDS defaults below are calibrated for a Pixel 10 emulator
(1080x2424). If that's what you're running and Hinge hasn't shifted
its layout, they should work as-is. Otherwise run `python calibrate.py`
and update the values that don't match your device.

.env variables override every config.py value at import time.

#                    spent.

# When to flip this to True:
#   - Free Hinge (8 likes/day): YES, for your first run or two. Lets
#     you watch decisions without spending your daily cap on a rubric
#     you haven't tuned. Once decisions look right, flip back to False.
#   - Hinge+ (unlimited likes): NO. Just run small live batches
#     (MAX_LIKES_PER_SESSION = 5) and Ctrl-C if something looks off.

# DRY_RUN_MESSAGE = True  -> still like, still generate the message in the

#                             logged in decision.txt so you can review it

# If you have Hinge+ (no daily cap), bump this to ~25-50 per session and
# run multiple sessions throughout the day. Going much higher per session
# tends to trigger Hinge's soft-throttle (empty Discover after a burst);
# spacing batches across the day works better than one giant batch.

# random cap between SESSION_LIKE_MIN and MAX_LIKES_PER_SESSION so the
