## Tip: open this repo in Claude Code or Codex

This repo ships with [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) (and [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md)).
If you cloned this and you're not sure where to start, open the
directory in Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, or any agent that
respects `AGENTS.md` and say _"help me set this up"_. The agent will
walk you through emulator config, calibration, writing a rubric, and
the first live run.

If you'd rather do it manually, read on.

## What it does

Drives an Android emulator running Hinge through ADB. For each profile it
scrolls top-to-bottom, screenshots the frames, asks Claude to judge against
a user-defined rubric, and either taps Skip or taps the heart and types a
personalized opener.

## Quickstart

1. Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and
   create an emulator. Pixel 10 (1080×2424) is the default target — other
   profiles will need re-calibration.
2. Sideload the Hinge APK into the emulator, sign in, get to the Discover
   tab. Make sure `adb devices` lists it.
3. Clone this repo and install deps:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Anthropic API key.
5. Run calibration — this saves a screenshot you read pixel coords from:
   ```
   python calibrate.py
   ```
   Open the resulting `calibrate.png` in any image viewer that shows cursor
   coordinates (Paint, IrfanView, Preview's tool inspector) and edit
   `config.py` `COORDS` to match.
6. Pick a mode in `modes/` (start with `example_lenient.py` or
   `example_strict.py`), set `ACTIVE_MODE` in `config.py` to match. The
   shipped `MAX_LIKES_PER_SESSION = 8` is calibrated to free Hinge's
   daily cap — leave it for your first run.
7. Run the loop:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   Watch the first few decisions print live. If a decision or opener
   looks wrong, Ctrl-C, edit `PREFERENCES` in your mode file, and re-run.
   With Hinge+, bump `MAX_LIKES_PER_SESSION` to 25–50 once decisions
   consistently match your rubric.

   (Optional) `DRY_RUN = True` in `config.py` runs the judge without
   sending likes, but every "would-like" profile gets force-skipped and
   is gone from your queue — usually not worth it. Small live batches
   are the better feedback loop.

## Bonus: scan your own profile

```
python scan_self.py
```

Taps through to your own profile's "View" tab (what other people see),
captures the frames, sends them to Claude, and writes a Markdown report
to `debug/self_scan_<timestamp>.md` with specific suggestions for
photos, prompts, and the overall hook. Run it once a week.

This is the one thing in this repo that doesn't violate Hinge's ToS —
no swiping, no messaging, just looking at your own content. Probably
the most useful tool in the repo.

## Writing your own mode

Three example rubrics ship in `modes/`:

- `example_lenient.py` — default-LIKE, generic. Good starting point.
- `example_strict.py` — default-SKIP, generic. The antonym.
- `cougar.py` — a themed mode: older age band (33-44) with playful
  young-buck premades. Shows how to combine `AGE_MIN/MAX`, an inline
  `MESSAGE_VOICE`, and themed `PREMADES`. This is the mode behind the
  framing that got the project some attention. Run it with
  `python main.py --mode cougar --set-filters` to also drive Hinge's
  in-app age slider.

- Copy `modes/template.py.example` to `modes/<your_name>.py`.
- Edit `PREFERENCES` to describe what should and shouldn't get a like.
- Optionally set `MESSAGE_VOICE` to one of the templates under `voice/`
  (e.g. `"example_casual"` or `"example_polished"`), or paste a multi-line
  rubric string directly.
- Optionally populate `PREMADES` with verbatim openers Claude can pick
  from instead of writing fresh copy.
- Point `ACTIVE_MODE` in `config.py` at the new file, or pass
  `--mode <your_name>` on the command line.

## Calibration

ADB drives the emulator by tapping absolute pixel coordinates. The
shipped `config.COORDS` is calibrated for the **Pixel 10 emulator
(1080×2424)** — if that's what you're using, it should work as-is.
For other devices or after Hinge UI updates, re-calibrate:

- `python calibrate.py` — main coords (skip / heart / scroll / nav bar
  / self-profile path / filter chips). Captures a screenshot you read
  pixel coords from.
- `python calibrate_filters.py` — Age filter slider coords. Only needed
  if you plan to use `python main.py --set-filters` to drive the in-app
  age range.
- `python calibrate_matches.py` — Matches-tab tap target. Only needed if
  you run `matches_scan.py` to scrape your conversations list.

The location picker (`locations.py`) needs a `location_coords.json` file.
A schema is provided at `location_coords.json.example` — copy it, rename,
and fill in real pixel coords by hand from a `calibrate.py` screenshot.
(The original project had a `calibrate_locations.py` interactive helper
but it was never written; PRs welcome.)

## Architecture

```
ADB capture  →  frame stitching  →  Claude judge  →  action
   adb.py        config / main         judge.py       main.py
                                       vision.py      adb.py
```

- **`adb.py`** wraps the `adb` CLI: screenshot, tap, swipe, type.
- **`main.py`** is the loop. For each profile: scroll-to-top, capture
  N frames, run them through the active backend's `judge()`, then
  either skip or scroll back, tap the heart, type the opener, and tap
  Send Like.
- **`judge_common.py`** holds the backend-agnostic pieces: system prompt
  template, JSON tool schema, `Decision` dataclass, voice resolver, and
  the `load_backend()` dispatcher.
- **`judge.py`** is the Anthropic backend — Claude vision + forced tool
  call. Caches the system prompt to keep cost down.
- **`judge_ollama.py`** is the Ollama backend (Cloud or local).
- **`vision.py`** finds UI elements whose absolute position shifts
  per-profile (heart icon on photo 1, Send Like button, comment input).
  Pixel-level detection, not OCR.
- **`modes/`** holds rubric files. `config._apply_mode()` copies the
  active mode's `PREFERENCES`, `AGE_MIN/MAX`, `MESSAGE_VOICE`, and
  `PREMADES` onto the `config` module so the rest of the code reads
  them via `config.<name>`.
- **`voice/`** holds opener-tone templates that modes can reference by
  name.
- **`metrics.py`** appends one JSONL record per profile to
  `debug/session_log.jsonl` for after-the-fact analysis.
- **`filters.py` / `locations.py`** drive Hinge's in-app filter sheets
  (age, neighborhood). Both need calibrated coord files.
- **`matches_scan.py`** scrapes the Matches tab via a separate Claude
  vision pass — for analytics, not for the swipe loop.
- **`scan_self.py`** captures the user's own profile (via the "View"
  tab) and asks Claude for improvement suggestions. The non-swiping
  feature of the repo; nothing here violates Hinge ToS.

## Safety and rate limits

- `MAX_LIKES_PER_SESSION = 8` is the shipped default — matches free
  Hinge's daily cap (resets 4am local). One session per day exhausts
  the free allotment.
- **Get Hinge+** if you're going to use this seriously. Without it the
  daily cap makes the tool pointless. With it, the bot becomes the most
  efficient way to use the subscription — you get the full like
  allotment without ever opening the app. With Hinge+, raise the cap
  to 25–50 per session and spread batches across the day. One giant
  batch tends to trip Hinge's soft-throttle (empty Discover).
- Don't change locations more than ~2 times per day. Frequent MyMove
  changes get throttled.
- One account. Don't run this on your real Hinge account.
- Anthropic API spend at the free-tier cap is negligible (~$0.25/day
  on Sonnet at 8 likes + skipped profiles). Watch the running totals
  printed each loop if you raise the cap.

## Backends: Anthropic API vs Ollama (free)

The judge pipeline ships with two interchangeable backends. Pick via
`JUDGE_BACKEND` in `config.py`.

### `"anthropic"` (default, recommended)

Uses Claude with vision + forced tool calling. Best quality decisions
and best opener writing. Roughly **$0.02–$0.05 per profile** on Sonnet
at medium effort.

Setup:
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Put `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...` in `.env`.
3. Leave `JUDGE_BACKEND = "anthropic"` in `config.py`.

### `"ollama"` (free — Ollama Cloud or local)

Uses an open-weight vision model through Ollama. **No per-token cost**
on the free tier of Ollama Cloud, or fully local on your own GPU.

Setup:
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -r requirements-ollama.txt`
2. Either:
   - **Ollama Cloud** — sign up at <https://ollama.com>, create an API
     key, set `OLLAMA_API_KEY=...` in your `.env`, and set
     `OLLAMA_HOST = "https://ollama.com"` in `config.py`.
   - **Local Ollama** — install Ollama, `ollama pull qwen2.5-vl`, run
     `ollama serve`. Leave `OLLAMA_HOST = None` (defaults to
     `http://localhost:11434`).
3. Set `JUDGE_BACKEND = "ollama"` in `config.py`.

Honest tradeoffs:
- **Decision quality** on a 7-screenshot judgment is meaningfully worse
  than Sonnet — expect more wrong skips on good profiles and more
  generic openers.
- **Tool-calling reliability** varies by model. `qwen2.5-vl` is the
  best of the open-weight options as of this writing. If you see
  `RuntimeError: Ollama (...) did not return a usable
  submit_decision call`, try a larger variant (`qwen2.5-vl:32b`) or
  switch to `llama3.2-vision`.
- The `matches_scan.py` analytics scrape still uses Anthropic — it's a
  separate tool, not the swipe loop, and the swap there isn't wired up.

Both backends share the same system prompt, schema, and `Decision`
shape (in `judge_common.py`) — only the API call differs.
