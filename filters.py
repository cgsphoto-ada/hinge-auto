"""Drive Hinge's in-app filter UI via ADB.

Currently supports the Age filter only. Coords live in `filter_coords.json`
(per-device, gitignored). Generate by running `python calibrate_filters.py`
or by hand-editing if you already know the layout.

The Age sheet's two slider thumbs share a slope (px-per-year) but have
different x-anchors — each thumb's center is offset by the thumb radius
relative to its logical position on the track. Calibration records each
thumb's anchor separately.

`set_age_range(age_min, age_max)`:
  1. Tap the Age chip on Discover -> bottom sheet animates up.
  2. Detect current thumb x-positions by thickness-thresholded pixel scan.
  3. Compute target x for each thumb via linear map from calibration.
  4. Swipe each thumb to its target. Drag-order avoids thumb collision.
  5. Tap Apply -> sheet dismisses, filter takes effect.

Hinge+/X may be required for custom age ranges on some accounts. If the
slider snaps back after Apply, the loop runner will surface this on the
next profile via the age-gate skip path.
